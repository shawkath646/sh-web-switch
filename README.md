## Project Insights
During the development of SH-WEB-SWITCH, I encountered several challenges and gained valuable insights:
1. **Keeping Up with Evolving Technologies:** Technology evolves rapidly, and I had been away from coding for a while due to my HSC examination. This project pushed me to learn and adapt to the latest technologies to stay updated.
2. **First-time TypeScript Usage:** I incorporated TypeScript into my projects for the first time, which enhanced type safety and code quality.
3. **Implementing Client-side and Server-side Protection:** Maintaining client-side protection and server-side access control for the application was a challenging but essential task.
4. **Guest Login System:** I introduced a guest login system with blank response for the first time, enhancing user experience.
5. **Debugging and Server Errors:** Dealing with hidden bugs and server errors proved to be a common challenge, leading to extensive troubleshooting efforts.
